                    <p class="intro-text"> My name is Yrja, born and raised Dutch and currently living in beautiful Amsterdam.
                        I am a recently graduated Full Stack Developer, 
                        of which Front-end Development is the direction I want to focus on full time.
                        <br><br>
                        About two years ago I took the step to retrain from professional Barista to Full Stack (web) Developer. 
                        For this I followed the Front-end and Back-end Development courses at Winc Academy and recently successfully completed them.
                        <br><br>
                        My interest in Code&Design has led my new career choice in this direction and is the reason why I am seeking 
                        for an internship or traineeship to further develop myself as a Junior Front-end Developer. <br><br>

                                Travelling is something I really love to do.
                                I like to discover unique places that earth has given us.
                                Mountains and high cliffs are my favourite places to visit when I travel.
                                Madeira Island is my ultimate favorite so far, the diversity of nature is just perfect for me.
                                My visit to La Palma, Tenerife and La Gomera has made me very interested in volcanism these days.
                                I secretly hope to experience an eruption from a safe distance one day. <br><br>
                                Next trips: Norway & Scotland.

                            <li> <span> Body & Mind </span><br> 
                                Rocycle (indoor cycling) is my every day physical activity and mindfulness. 
                                It creates mental clearity and sharps my concentration to stay focussed on my goals for the day.
                            </li>

                            <li> <span> Creativity & Engineering </span><br>
                                I like to draw and paint. I don't have a specific theme or style that I like to draw, 
                                it often depends on the moment. In the near future I would like to learn and create digital art 
                                that I can use in my personal coding projects.<br><br>

                                I express my creativity in several things; interior styling, fashion, 
                                original gifts for friends and writing. <br><br>

                                In my spare time I like to build construction content for the Sims 4 Online Community.
                                My engineering skills comes in very handy sometimes during complicated build-creations.
                                People from the community can download my content and use it in their Sims game.

                            <li> <span> Social & Happy </span><br>
                                I'm a very venturous person, I like to go out and do things.
                                Such as going out for dinners and discovering new restaurants in town,
                                Hanging upside down on a roller coaster at an amusement park or just visiting art museums and expos. 
                                Dancing at music festivals, attending football matches at my club's stadium and getting together 
                                with my friends for Formula1 races are the best. <br><br>

                                As a huge animal lover, I like to work for charity. I collect donations from friends and family in 
                                the form of pet food for local animal shelters once in a while. <br><br>
                                
                                I am a cat-mom of two cats, two sisters, which I both adopted from a foundation dedicated to rescuing stray cats from the streets.
                                It is satisfying to see that they are still growing every day in the socialization process with humans. 
                                It makes me happy that I can offer them a safe home and pamper them with my love.
                                Unfortunately I don't have enough space at home to adopt more cats, because I would like to help them all. <br><br>

                <h2> Video Landing page </h2>
                <p> A self-created project for this portfolio is a video animated background web page with an educational
                    purpose. One of the billion things I am interested in is the galaxy and universe, 
                    with this subject I could really bring the feeling of being there.

                <h2> CSS Animations </h2>
                <p> An additional feature with CSS are animated texts and images as soon as the web page loads. 
                    To showcase what I can do with CSS animations for a web page or web application, 
                    I created this fictional Food Blog project as an example.  </p>

                <h2> Model Box </h2>
                <p> It is impossible to imagine the website world without pop-up banners.
                    Out of curiousity how they are build and work, I created this Model Box for a Webshop
                    which appears as soon as the mouse leaves the browser window and returns.

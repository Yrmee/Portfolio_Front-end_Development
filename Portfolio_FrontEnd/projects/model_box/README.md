# Model Box - Mouse Leave Popup Box
It is impossible to imagine the website world without pop-up banners.
Out of curiousity how they are build and work, I created this Model Box for a Webshop which appears as soon as the mouse leaves the browser window and returns.

* ### When the cursor leaves the browser window, the Model Box will appear.
